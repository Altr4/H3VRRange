# Shooty Range
This is made with Wurstmod that you'll need to download first: https://github.com/Nolenz/WurstMod

This is a H3VR range scene made with practically zero experience and knowledge so expect some weird collision stuff happening. The range set up is inspired from InrangeTV's competition videos.
Thank you for understanding.

How to Install:

0.5 Install Wurstmod first
1. Download the Range.zip in "Release"
2. Go to your H3VR folder (right click H3VR on steam -> manage -> browse local files)
3. Open Customs Level -> Generic
4. Extract Range folder in Generic Folder
5. When you get into the game, the Scene should be right behind you

For visual learner: Janky shitty GIF incoming!

Expect Issue:
1. Spinner target won't rest vertically on their own, you can help it rest vertically by touching it slightly with your bullet
2. Blue barrel have jank collision if you rest something on top of it
3. Cannot use the "brace" feature on any of the object
