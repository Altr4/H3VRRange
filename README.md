# H3VRRange
This is made with Wurstmod that you'll need to download first: https://github.com/Nolenz/WurstMod

This is a H3VR range scene made with practically zero experience and knowledge so expect some weird collision stuff happening.
Thank you for understanding.

How to Install:

0.5 Install Wurstmod first
1. Download the Range.zip in "Release"
2. Go to your H3VR folder
3. Open Customs Level -> Generic
4. Extract Range folder in Generic Folder
5. When you get into the game, the Scene should be right behind you
